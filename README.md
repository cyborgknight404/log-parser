# 🔍 Log Parser

This is a simple Python script designed to parse syslog-style log files and flag suspicious entries based on user-defined patterns or keywords.

## ✅ Features (Planned)

- Parse `.log` or `.txt` files line by line
- Highlight entries with suspicious keywords (e.g. "error", "failed", "unauthorized")
- Output filtered results to screen or new file
- Add optional timestamp filtering

## 🛠 Built With

- Python 3.11
- Regex
- Standard file I/O

## 📂 Example Use Case

You're triaging logs in a SOC environment and want to quickly flag potential brute-force or access errors from a dump of raw log files.

## 🚧 Status

In development — part of my home lab project to practice log analysis and scripting.
